# Prototype Backend for BruinClassPals

This repository contains the prototype backend for **BruinClassPals**, a social class-planning application designed for UCLA students. The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, and it provides the server-side logic for user authentication, profile management, and database interactions.
